The goal of this project is to develop an **AI-powered guidance system for indoor navigation** designed for large, crowded venues such as stadiums, events, malls, and festivals
Madar helps attendees navigate entrances, exits, and facilites, while also enabling them to locate family members or friends easily  
The system aims to improve visitors satisfication and reduce confusion during large gatherings
